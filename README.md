## Task 2: Predicting customer buying behavior
Build a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behavior

* Prepare the data by performing EDA and feature engineering techniques
* Create a classification model to predict customer buying behavior
* Prepare a PowerPoint representation to highlight obtained insights and analysis
